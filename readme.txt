The aim of this project is to explore gravitational lensing by simulation.
This program uses several methods to simulate this effect.

A rudimentary user interface is given to run each function offering varying results.
Instructions are mostly given in the interface but further instructions are given below:

For all simulations, a value of ellipticity of 0 gives the nicest plots, ~0.1 shows some distortion without ruining the plot.

The least CPU intensive function is lensing through an uploaded image (an image is provided).

The point plot, random galxay distribution plot and chess board plot are relatively intensive.
Values of pixels rxr of 101 should give a nice plot and shouldnt take too long.
For the amount of galaxys, about half the value of r should give a nice distribution.

The last 2 programs, varying ellipticity and moving lens, are the most CPU intensive.
This is because they essentially lens an image many times over.
For both functions a value of frames ~50 produces a smooth string of images.
Creating a video/GIF from these images looks great.
Instead of producing a video/GIF, it is easy to click on one of the images in the plots window and hold the down arrow.
This is an easy way to produce the same effect.
The downside of these functions is how long they take to run at this amount of frames.
A lower amount of frames can be used to show the general effect.

Thanks, enjoy the program.
